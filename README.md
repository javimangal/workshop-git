# How to Use

In order to replicate these analyses, I suggest that the user follows these steps:
1. Install [R and RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) on your computer if you haven't done so. (Note that these analyses were conducted under R version 4.4.0 and RStudio 2024.04.0).
2. [Clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). If you do not know how to do this, [you can follow these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop). 
3. You should now have all these files in your computer with an identical folder structure (described in the following section).
4. In the main directory, open the file named ***simple-r-project.Rproj*** in RStudio.
5. You can navigate through the folders on the right-bottom panel of R Studio. Open the **R** folder. You should now see a series of R scripts.
